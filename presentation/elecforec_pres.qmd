# 1. Election Forecasting


## Problem

<!-- The LS method is an iterative method that at each iteration computes the -->
<!-- search direction and then decides how far to move along that direction. -->



# 2. Data


## Type of Data

Forecasting elections makes use of mainly two different types data:    

- **Fundamental indicators**, that is economic or political variables  
  
- **Trial-heat polls**, that is surveys with trail-heat questions issued by oﬀicial 
pollsters’ agency  


## Fundamental Indicators

The **economy** strongly affect and anticipate election results. Among the most 
used economic indicator there are GDP, GNP, unemployment, inflation at national 
or state level.  

The **political dimension** of election is also of high relevance and it is usually 
measured by incumbency, time-for-change, votes of previous elections, presidential 
home-state advantage, president approval rating.  

Many models have been developed using only such data and predicted the results 
within few percentage points.  


## Trial-Heat Polls

**Survey** responses are related to actual voting process, meaning that polls are 
connected to observable political behaviours and incorporate the process of updating
information of individuals, so that can be used to track the evolution of 
preferences over time and states.  

Election polls data suffers of some well-known problems such as sampling errors, 
house effect, question wording, response errors and high variability.  

Nowadays many pollster agencies exist, producing surveys both at the national 
and state levels, in particular during the election year.  


# 3. Methods

## Type of Models

Over the years, mainly three types of election forecasting models evolved:  

- **Structural models**, econometric models based on fundamental indicators  
  
- **Trial-heat models**, econometric models relying on polls data  

- **Bayesian models**, models that use polls data to update historical forecasts, 
improving the performance of structural models through the incorporation of 
voters preferences’ evolution.  

The variable of interest is usually the percentage election outcome of one of 
the two major parties.  


## Structural Models

The **Time-for-change model** is one of the most successful and was proposed by 
Abramowitz in 1988 (and again in 1996 and 2008).  
$$Y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 GDP_{t-1} + \beta_2 Approval_t + \beta_3 TC_t$$  

It assumes that voters positively evaluate periodic government alternation of the
two major parties.  

It relies only on previous elections’ data without incorporating the opinion about 
the current election.  


## Trial-Heat Models

Using trial-heat polls as literal forecast produce very poor results, because the 
accuracy of election polls depends enormously on when the poll is conducted.  

*Gelman and King* incorporated current polls information within a more complex 
structural model considering the aggregate trial-heat two months before the 
election, incumbency, GNP rate, approval rating and state variables.  

*Campbell*, instead, improved the poor trial-heat literal prediction suggesting a 
simple regression model that used only trial-heat polls at national level and 
the second quarter growth rate of GDP.  


## Bayesian Models

Since the late 90s, methods implementing a Bayesian approach have been 
introduced also in the context of election prediction.  

Bayesian models naturally follow the **"voters' enlightenment"** hypothesis 
because the weights voters attach to fundamental variables are allowed to change 
during the campaign, accounting for changes in public opinion.  

- **Core idea**: to use polls data to update historical forecasts, accounting for 
current voters' preferences and improving the performance of structural models.  


## Bayesian Models - Rigdon et al.

- Assumes that the beliefs about election's outcomes are based on historical voting 
trends

- Considers the proportions of third-party candidates and undecided

- Uses informative prior (based on previous election results) and current 
likelihood (based on ongoing poll data) for each state to estimate the posterior 
distribution, that is each candidate's probability of winning that state.  


## Bayesian Models - Rigdon et al.

$$X = (X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4) \sim MULTINOMIAL(n, p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4)$$
$$p = (p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4) \sim DIRICHLET(b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4)$$

where $X_i$ are the sample proportions in a state poll and $p_i$ are the shares 
in a state of candidate $i$  
<!-- the proportions $p_i$ are assumed to be continuous in $[0,1]$, to satisfy  -->
<!-- $\sum_{i = 1}^{4} p_i = 1$ and their joint distribution has to be a conjugate prior  -->
<!-- for a Multinomial. -->
$$P(p|X) \sim C \cdot P(p) \cdot P(X|p)$$
$$P(p|X) \sim DIRICHLET(x_1 + b_1, x_2 + b_2, x_3 + b_3, x_4 + b_4)$$
<!-- The calibration and the choice of parameters are based on historical election  -->
<!-- reasoning. For instance, normal votes (i.e. votes from last elections) are used  -->
<!-- for the two major parties, while for third-party is the combined third-party  -->
<!-- normal vote, and the level of undecided is assumed to be 3% by previous polls'  -->
<!-- trends. -->


## Bayesian Models - Linzer



# 4. Conclusions

## Conclusions

- Using the Bayesian approach, it is possible to produce **continuously revised 
forecasts** as new poll data is released  
<!-- This allows to account for changes in public opinion, updating the weights voters  -->
<!-- assign to the fundamental variables and possibly improving the predictions. -->

- **Comparing performances** of different models is difficult (different elections, 
different horizons, different levels)  

- In general, forecasts are accurate **within 2 months** before the election day 
and forecasting using both structural variables and poll data outperform others  

- It is **still difficult** to produce timely and accurate forecasts  

- **Problems** arise in forecasting accuracy and uncertainty for states that are 
polled few and in those days with no polls at all  


## Conclusions

- **Web data** as a source of spontaneous public opinions to solve lack of data 
issues (as *Rizk et. al, 2023*)  
<!-- Social networks, blogs and forums contain a huge amount of data related to  -->
<!-- individuals' preferences that can be exploited during the election period to  -->
<!-- estimate the share of vote for all the candidates over all the states. -->

- **Correlated vote intentions** across states (for example, if a candidate is 
performing bad in a state, this might indicate that he will also underperform in 
other states)  
<!-- possibly because there were hidden voters for the opposing candidate that  -->
<!-- polls missed in that state and may equally have been missed in others). -->

These factors may help to improve early forecast accuracy of the models.
